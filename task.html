        <p>He grew up in a privileged atmosphere in a rich home. His father trained him by private governesses and tutors. Nehru became interested in science and theosophy under the influence of Ferdinand T. Brooks' tutelage.

        <p>In October 1907, Nehru visited Trinity College, Cambridge, and graduated with an honours degree in science in 1910. He also studied politics, economics, history, and literature with little interest during this time. Most of his political and financial philosophy was molded by the writings of Bernard Shaw</p>

         <p>During his time in Britain as a student and a barrister, Nehru developed an interest in Indian politics. Nehru attended an annual session of the Indian National Congress in Patna within months of his return to India in 1912. In 1912, Congress was the party of progressives and elites, and he was disconcerted by what he saw as "very much an English-knowing upper-class affair."</p>
